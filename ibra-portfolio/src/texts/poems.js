const poem = "A killer terrifies\n Who? A killer\n Is he a terrorist? Who? A killer?\n What is the difference? It's the same\n He is a natural born life timer on a life cycle\n Hey kill me once and you will remember 4 ever\n kill me once and you won't kill me twice\n He looked like a beast to devour my soul\n Was I terrifed?\n Yes because he is a killer, he is full of terror\n Is he a killer or a terrorist, he is both and it is the same\n He owns nuclear weapons, a disaster yet he is called a leader and a defender, am terrified\n Oh states men, oh my little ones, oh little creatures\n the future is bent\n Is he a soul taker? no, he is powerless,\n He vanishes after and no one wants to tell his story."
