const autobio = "Afrik's roots are in East Africa. He has made a home in Canada with his wife and four children. He still has strong ties to Africa though. He is a long time poet and song writer. The main message throughout his music is one of peace and unity.  Whilst some songs are in the language of Luganda and pertain to political discourse in Uganda, the underlying theme in his work is one of world peace. Afrik wrote 'Freedom Song' many years ago, and kept it in his back pocket.  More recently, he worked with Orchid Studios, in Vancouver, Canada to revitalize and release it."
