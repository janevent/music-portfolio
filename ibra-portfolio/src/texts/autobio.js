const autobio = "Afrik's roots are in East Africa. Although he has made a home in Canada with his family, he still has strong ties to Africa. He is a long time poet and song writer. The main message throughout his music is one of peace and unity.  Whilst some songs are in the languages of Luganda, Kinyarwanda, and Swahili, and pertain to political discourse in Africa, the underlying theme in his work is one of world peace. Afrik wrote 'Freedom Song' many years ago, and kept it in his back pocket.  More recently, he worked with Orchid Studios, in Vancouver, Canada, to revitalize and release it.  Afrik is a Patron Diaspora of KAWEECHIPA, an acronym for Kawempe Women Empowerment To Enhance Child Protection Agenda."
